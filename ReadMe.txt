Arduino "Breadboard Helpers"
by Jack Christensen
Sep 2011

Breadboard Helpers are two small breakout boards, that along with an ATmega328P microcontroller, allow you to easily build an Arduino-compatible breadboard in a minute or less!  Breadboard Helpers contain all the necessary support circuitry for the microcontroller: FTDI and ICSP programming headers, reset button, "pin 13" LED, crystal and loading capacitors (or ceramic resonator), bypass and filter capacitors, and power connections.

See my blog post describing Breadboard Helpers in more detail:

A bill of materials with all the components needed, including the microcontroller and a breadboard, is available at the link below.  Note that if you order the microcontroller from Mouser, it is a raw factory part and will need to be programmed with an Arduino bootloader.
